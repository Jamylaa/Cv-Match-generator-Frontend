- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization library

### API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API through RESTful endpoints:

- `/api/mongodb/candidates`: Candidate management
- `/api/mongodb/offers`: Job offer management
- `/api/mongodb/match`: Matching functionality
- `/api/mongodb/stats`: Statistics and analytics

## User Flow

1. **Home Page**: Overview of the system with navigation to main features
2. **Candidates Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete candidate profiles
3. **Job Offers Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete job offers
4. **Matching**: Select a candidate and find matching job offers
5. **Statistics**: View system statistics and analytics

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Authentication**: Add login/registration functionality
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance search and filtering capabilities
3. **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk actions on candidates/offers
4. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket for live updates
5. **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version using React Native
